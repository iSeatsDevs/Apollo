Modals can be used with the `<Modal></Modal>` component. You can activate a modal using
any `onClick` function by setting the state of the modals visibility to true like so:
```
<Modal onExit={() => setOpenState(false)}>
  <Text>Are you sure you want to do this?</Text>
</Modal>
```

<Story name="Default">

    Good things happen when people can move, whether across town or towards
    their dreams. Opportunities appear, open up, become reality. What started as
    a way to tap a button to get a ride has led to billions of moments of human
    connection as people around the world go all kinds of places in all kinds of
    ways with the help of our technology.
