      Good things happen when people can move, whether across town or towards
      their dreams. Opportunities appear, open up, become reality. What started as
      a way to tap a button to get a ride has led to billions of moments of human
      connection as people around the world go all kinds of places in all kinds of
      ways with the help of our technology.

### Ellipses

Using the ellipses prop, we can hide overflowing lines by either using a integer set as a maximum letter, or a simple boolean.
